### **🛠 Fixing React 19 Conflict & Ensuring `react-konva` Works with React 18**
### **🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴 Navigate to project diractory, in this case `my-app`🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴
---

### **🔴 Step 1: Completely Remove React & React-Konva**
Run the following commands to **fully remove all incorrect versions**:
```sh
npm uninstall react react-dom react-konva
```
Then **remove `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`**:
```sh
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```
(This is important to clean dependencies and avoid conflicts.)

---

### **🟢 Step 2: Install Correct Versions**
Now, reinstall **React 18 and `react-konva@18.1.0`**:
```sh
npm install react@18 react-dom@18 react-konva@18.1.0
```
Verify the versions:
```sh
npm list react react-dom react-konva
```
Expected output:
```
├── react@18.x.x
├── react-dom@18.x.x
└── react-konva@18.1.0
```

---

### **🟢 Step 3: Clean Cache and Reinstall Dependencies**
Just to be extra sure, clean the cache:
```sh
npm cache clean --force
npm install
```

---

### **🟢 Step 4: Restart the Project**
Now, run your React app again:
```sh
npm start
```

---

### **🎯 Why Does This Fix the Issue?**
- **React 19 is still in beta**, so it's causing compatibility issues.
- **`react-konva@18.1.0` requires React 18**, but your project had **React 19** installed.
- **Removing `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`** ensures a clean install.
